# Repo Cloning!

Cloning this repo will take some time due to the videos in the public folder. However, once those are on your local system, you should be good to go.

## npm i @mui/material

@mui/material is utilized in the client component to create video reactions from users with their like, comment and share. So, there's need to run the install in the destination system

## Video folder to become json index
Based on recent research using Stackoverflow and AI, it's suggested to make the video folder to become json as shown below. So, I'm suggesting making the modification to reflect that:

../public/videos/index.json
[
  "sample1.mp4",
  "sample2.mp4",
  "sample3.mp4"
]

### This should be unnecessary if you use local file services, as designed.
